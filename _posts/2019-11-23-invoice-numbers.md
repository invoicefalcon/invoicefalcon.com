title:  "Set a numbering sequence for your invoices"
---

With Invoice Falcon, you can choose to have the numbers for your invoices follow the same number as your orders, or you can set a custom numbering sequence that gets updated automatically.

Click on **Invoice Settings** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Invoice Number, Date & Copies** tab in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -

<br/>
**<u>Same as order number</u>**
<br/>
By default, Invoice Falcon will use the order number (or draft order number) as the invoice number. Invoices that are created manually will follow their own numbering sequence.

If you want to use the same number as your order, _but you'd also like to have a prefix or identifier to indicate that the document is an invoice_ (as may be required by law in some countries), enter the prefix in the **Invoice Number Prefix** field.

Example - If your order number is **#1080** and the invoice number prefix is **IFS**, the invoice number will be **IFS#1080**.

<br/>
**<u>Custom numbering sequence</u>**
<br/>
When you set up a custom numbering sequence, the invoices will have a number that are completely different from the order numbers for which they are created.

To set this up, enter a number of your choice in the **Next Invoice Number** field. You can enter a number like '10001' or 'ABGN12034'. Make sure to click 'Save Changes after entering this number.

Invoice numbers for invoices created before this change will not be updated automatically. If you'd like to change numbers for previous invoices, please contact us via live chat or email.

<br/>
Note - _If you want to stop using a custom numbering sequence, remove the number from the Next Invoice Number field and click 'Save Changes'._
