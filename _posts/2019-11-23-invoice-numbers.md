With Invoice Falcon, you can choose to have the numbers for your invoices follow the same number as your orders, or you can set a custom numbering sequence that gets updated automatically.

Click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Invoice Number, Date & Copies** tab in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -

<br/>
<b>By default, Invoice Falcon will use the order number (or draft order number) as the document number.</b> Documents that are created manually (for example, invoices or quotes that are not linked to a Shopify order/draft order) will follow their own numbering sequence.

For example, if an order on your store is labelled/identified as "IFS-1080-EN", then the default invoice number will also be "IFS-1080-EN".
<br/>
<br/>
**<u>Use order number instead of order name</u>**
<br/>
Shopify uses two separate identifiers for every order on your store. One of them is order name, which is the label/identifier to your customers and the other is order number, which Shopify tracks and is known only to you.

For example, if an order name is 'IFS-1080-EN', the order number is '1080'. (Please note that this might not be the case for your store.)

As described above, Invoice Falcon uses the order name as the default invoice number for your invoices. If you'd like to use the order number as the invoice number, enable the checkbox labelled "Use order number instead of order name".

<br/>
<br/>
**<u>Custom number sequence</u>**
<br/>
When you set up a custom numbering sequence, the invoices will have a number that are completely different from the order names/numbers for which they are created.

To set this up, enter a number of your choice in the **Next Invoice Number** field. You can enter a number like '10001' or 'ABGN12034'. Make sure to click 'Save Changes after entering your number.

The custom number will be automatically increased by 1 every time you create a new invoice. For example, if the number saved was "ABGN12034", the second invoice created will have the number "ABGN12035".

Note - _If you want to stop using a custom numbering sequence, remove the number from the Next Invoice Number field and click 'Save Changes'._

<br/>
<br/>
**<u>Invoice Number Prefix</u>**
<br/>
If you want to use the same name/number as your order, _but you'd also like to have a prefix or identifier to indicate that the document is an invoice_ (as may be required by law in some countries), enter the prefix in the **Invoice Number Prefix** field.

Example - If your order number is **#1080** and the invoice number prefix is **IFS**, the invoice number will be **IFS#1080**.
