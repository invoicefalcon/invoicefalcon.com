With Invoice Falcon, you can add a custom message to all of your invoices. This custom message can be a simple thank you note to customers for their purchase, or you can also use it to place important payment/bank account information for customers making payments after placing their order.

Click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Thank you Message & Social Media** section in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -

<br/>
**<u>Thank you message</u>**
<br/>
Enter your custom message in this field. Your custom message can be as long as you'd like, and separated into multiple paragraphs. In the example above, we've shown you how you can use this space for showing your bank account information.

Make sure to click 'Save Changes' after you're done! Your existing invoices will be automatically updated to include the changes you made here the next time it's printed, sent or downloaded. :)
