1. Click on **Invoices** tab in the left menu bar of our app.
2. Here, you'll find a list of all the orders from your Shopify store.
3. You can search for orders based on date range or financial status. You can also scroll through the pages of orders from here by clicking on the 'Back' and 'Front' keys at the bottom of this page.
4. Once you've found the order you're looking for, click on the blue highlighted order name to generate the invoice for that order. This will redirect you to a separate page where you can review the invoice before printing or sending it to your customer.
5. If you'd like to print or send your invoice without previewing it, click on the 'Print' or 'Send' icon on the right side of the row containing the order name.
