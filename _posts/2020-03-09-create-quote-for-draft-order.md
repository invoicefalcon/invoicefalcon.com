1. Click on **Quotes** tab in the left menu bar of our app.
2. Here, you'll find a list of all the draft orders from your Shopify store.
3. Select the status that your draft order belongs to in the "Select Draft Order Status" section of this list.
4. Once you've found the order you're looking for, click on the blue highlighted order name to generate the quote for that order. This will redirect you to a separate page where you can review the quote before printing or sending it to your customer.
5. If you'd like to print or send your quote without previewing it, click on the 'Print' or 'Send' icon on the right side of the row containing the draft order name.
