In some countries/regions, it may be required to save & send multiple copies like a 'Duplicate', 'Triplicate', 'Customer Copy' etc to comply with regulations. With Invoice Falcon, you can print/download multiple copies of an invoice. Not only that, but you can also choose to send a specific copy of the invoice to your customers.

<p style="text-align:center;">Here's how the name of the copy looks in your invoice.</p>
<br/>
Click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Invoice Number, Date & Copies** section in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -

<p style="text-align:center;">Settings to print multiple copies and to set the name of the copy for your customer</p>

<br/>
**<u>Default Copy Title</u>**
<br/>
This is the name of the copy that will be sent to your customers. When a copy name is added here, it will be shown next to the title at the top of your invoice.

<br/>
**<u>Copy Names</u>**
<br/>
Here, you can enter a comma-separated list of copies that you'd like to print for every invoice. For example, if you'd like to print/download a Duplicate, Triplicate and Customer Copy for every invoice, you can enter the list like this - Duplicate,Triplicate,Customer Copy

Please note that all copies will be combined into a single PDF file when the invoice is printed/downloaded.

If you have set Copy Names but you have not set a Default Copy Title, the invoice sent to your customers from our app will not include a copy name. For a copy name to be shown when an invoice is sent, you will need to enter a Default Copy Title.
