With Invoice Falcon, you can print packing slips for any of your documents. A packing slip specifies the items included in the order and is usually placed inside the box containing your customer's purchases.

To print a packing slip for your order, click on the 'Download Packing Slip' button when previewing the invoice. This will automatically generate and open the packing slip for you to print/download.

To set up your packing slip, click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Packing Slip** section in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -
