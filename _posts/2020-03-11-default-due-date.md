<br/>
**<u>Default Due Date</u>**
<br/>
In this field, enter the number of days by which your customer should complete their payment for the invoice. When the invoice is printed or sent to your customer, the due date will be calculated by adding this number of days to the date the invoice was issued.

<i>Note</i> - Please make sure to enter a whole number in this field.

<br/>
**<u>Where is the due date shown on the invoice?</u>**
<br/>
The due date for your invoice will be shown in the top section of the invoice, underneath the title of the document and right next to the Invoice Number.
