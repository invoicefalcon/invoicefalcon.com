A credit note is the opposite of an invoice - it's an official document to show your customer that a partial or full amount has been credited back to them. Credit notes are also known as return invoices in some countries. In effect, a credit note might either cancel an invoice out completely if itâ€™s for the same amount as the invoice, or it might be for less than the invoice.

In Invoice Falcon, credit notes have the same structure and template as your invoices. They will follow the same design settings as that of your invoices, with only minor changes/updates to reflect that it's a credit note and not an actual invoice.

You can manually generate credit notes for any invoice in Invoice Falcon. Follow these steps below to do so -
