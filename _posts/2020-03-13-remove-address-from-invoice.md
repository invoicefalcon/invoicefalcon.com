By default, Invoice Falcon generates invoices with 3 addresses in the top section of the invoice. The first is your store's address & the other two are the customer's shipping and billing addresses. In this article, we'll walk you through how you can disable any of these addresses from being shown on the invoice.

Click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Supplier, Shipping & Billing Addresses** section in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -
