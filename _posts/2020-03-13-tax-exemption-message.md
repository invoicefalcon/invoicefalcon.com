In some countries, depending on the size of your business, it may be required that you will need to mention that your prices are exempt of taxes in your invoice.

For example, in France, a business may need to place a message like this - 'Ce magasin a choisi le régime de la franchise des petites entreprises,par conséquent,nous ne facturons pas de taxes' (Translation - 'This store has chosen the small business franchise regime, therefore we do not charge taxes')

With Invoice Falcon, you can set this up in just a few simple clicks. Not only can you use this for your message related to tax exemption, <b>you can also use it to add a single line message to your customers.</b>

Click on **Invoice Design** in the left menu bar of our application & click on **Tax Compliance** section in this page. You'll see a few settings that look like this -

Enter your note for tax exemption in this field. Please note that this section does not accept multi-line paragraphs; it is best suited for a single line note that you'd like your customers to know about.

Make sure to click 'Save Changes' after you're done! Your existing invoices will be automatically updated to include the changes you made here the next time it's printed, sent or downloaded. :)
