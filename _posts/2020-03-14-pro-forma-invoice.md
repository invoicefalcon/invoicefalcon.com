A pro forma invoice is similar to an invoice, in that it includes almost exactly the same information as a normal invoice and is binding towards the final sale. The key difference is that a pro forma invoice is usually sent before a payment is made to make sure everything is in order.

In some countries or regions, it may be required that a pro forma invoice has to be sent to your customer before an official invoice is made.

With Invoice Falcon, you can create a pro forma invoice manually for orders outside your Shopify store.
