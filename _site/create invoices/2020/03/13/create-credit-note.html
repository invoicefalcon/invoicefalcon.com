    <p>A credit note is the opposite of an invoice - it’s an official document to show your customer that a partial or full amount has been credited back to them. Credit notes are also known as return invoices in some countries. In effect, a credit note might either cancel an invoice out completely if it’s for the same amount as the invoice, or it might be for less than the invoice.</p>

<p>In Invoice Falcon, credit notes have the same structure and template as your invoices. They will follow the same design settings as that of your invoices, with only minor changes/updates to reflect that it’s a credit note and not an actual invoice.</p>

<p>You can manually generate credit notes for any invoice in Invoice Falcon. Follow these steps below to do so -</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Credit note for existing invoices/orders</u></strong>

<ol>
