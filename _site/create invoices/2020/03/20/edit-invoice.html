<p><img src="/assets/img/edit-invoice/edit-button.png" alt="an image alt text" title="Edit button" /></p>

<p><br />
To begin editing or making changes to an invoice, click on the purple ‘Edit Document’ button when you are viewing an invoice in the Invoice Preview page. This button will be visible on the right side of your screen as shown above, and it will take you to our Document Editor page.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<hr />

<h4 id="2-add-important-details-to-your-invoice">2. Add important details to your invoice</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/img/edit-invoice/edit-details.png" alt="an image alt text" title="Edit important details" /></p>

<p><br />
The Document Editor consists of many sections, each built for changing specific details in your invoice. In the first section, you can choose your customer and update important details of the invoice like Purchase Order number and due date. We’ve highlighted a few of them here below -</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Payment Terms</u></strong>
<br />
Select from a set of payment terms for your invoice like NET30, NET60, NET90 and more. Payment terms will be shown in the top section of your invoice.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Payment/Due Date</u></strong>
<br />
Select a date by when your customer needs to complete payment for the invoice. This date will be auto-filled if you choose a Payment Term after you’ve entered an Issue Date.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Purchase Order Number</u></strong>
<br />
If your customer needs a purchase order reference in their invoice, you can enter it here. Purchase order #, like payment terms, is shown in the top section of the invoice.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Status</u></strong>
<br />
Select from a list of payment statuses for your invoice.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Currency</u></strong>
<br />
Change the currency of your invoice. Please note that changing the currency does not update the amounts based on live exchange rates. It only updates the currency in which the invoice will be sent.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Invoice Language</u></strong>
<br />
If you need to send the invoice to your customer in a language other than your default one, select it from the dropdown here.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="3-update-addresses-and-add-custom-information">3. Update addresses and add custom information</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/img/edit-invoice/edit-address-custom.png" alt="an image alt text" title="Update addresses and add custom information" /></p>

<p>To add or update the shipping address, click the ‘Add address’ (or ‘Edit address’) button in the ‘Ship To’ section. Similarly, to add or update the billing address, click the button in the ‘Bill To’ section. Clicking these buttons will open a popup where you can make your changes and save it on the invoice.</p>

<p>With Invoice Falcon, you can also add very specific custom information to the invoice. This custom information can be presented to your customer as a Header:Subtitle combination. For example, you can add a detail like ‘Shipping Date: 29th Feb, 2020’ or ‘Tracking #: ‘ABGN12345XXX’.</p>

<p>To add a custom detail, click on the ‘Edit Custom Fields’ button in the custom details section. This will open a popup where you can add your information and save it on the invoice.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Edit name, price or quantity</u></strong>
<br />
Click on the ‘Edit Product’ in the right side of the row containing the product you want to make changes to. This will open a popup, where you can make your changes and save it onto the invoice.</p>

<p><br />
