<p>In this page, you’ll see a preview of your invoice on the left. The contents of the invoice are based on a sample order &amp; shop, so that you can visualize the invoice that’ll be sent out. On the right, you’ll find a section to select the element of the invoice that you wish to customize. Click on any one of them to begin customizing your invoice.

<h3 id="free-plan-if-i-send-the-invoice-for-an-order-in-one-month-and-re-send-it-again-after-the-order-limit-is-reset-is-it-counted-towards-that-months-limit">(FREE PLAN) If I send the invoice for an order in one month and re-send it again after the order limit is reset, is it counted towards that month’s limit?</h3>
<p>Nope. If you’ve printed or sent the invoice for an order once, you’ll be able to print or send it, as many times as you wish to, for the lifetime of your store.
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<h3 id="im-not-able-to-see-the-invoice-when-i-click-print-or-download">I’m not able to see the invoice when I click “Print” or “Download”.</h3>
<p>This is most likely because your browser, by default, blocks popups and new tabs opened from the current page. An icon for this will be shown in the address bar. Simply click on the icon, and enable popups from our page or click on the link visible there to open the invoice.
