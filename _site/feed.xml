You’ll see a few settings that look like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/send-invoice/reply-address.png&quot; alt=&quot;an image alt text&quot; title=&quot;Set up the address you want email replies to&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you send an invoice from Invoice Falcon, your customer will see your store’s name as the sender of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email address that the invoice is sent from is invoices@invoicefalcon.com. However, all replies to any email from our app will go to the email address mentioned in the &lt;strong&gt;Email - Reply-to address&lt;/strong&gt; specified in the field here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter or update the address you’d like to receive replies to and click ‘Save’ right after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Invoice Falcon sends your invoice in an email with a standard subject &amp;amp; body. Here, you can edit the subject &amp;amp; body of the email to personalize it to your store &amp;amp; brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; button in the box labelled ‘Custom email template’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the type of document for which you’d like to edit the email template. The available document types are Invoice, Quote, Pro-Forma Invoice &amp;amp; Credit Note.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your desired subject and body in the fields provided.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to click ‘Save Changes’ after you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How do I use liquid variables?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We’ve provided a few liquid variables that you can use in your email template. Please note that these variables need to be exactly as they look in the Variables section. If they are not as specified, there may be issues with sending the emails to your customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use a liquid variable in your template, simply copy the variable you need by selecting the text, pressing Ctrl+C or Cmd+C and then pressing Ctrl+V or Cmd+V in any of the fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the email is sent to your customer, these fields will be resolved and replaced with the actual data for that invoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How do I use the {% if invoice.requires_payment %} variable?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This variable is designed to add a Stripe payment link to the invoice email. When this variable is added to your template, a piece of text (asking your customer to pay) and a link to complete the payment will be shown to your customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that setting up this payment link requires an Ultimate subscription and a Stripe account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this variable, please copy the following snippet of code to your email template -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% if invoice.requires_payment %}
Please complete the payment for your order by clicking on this link - {{ invoice.payment_link }}
{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - You can replace the text ‘Please complete the payment for your order by clicking on this link’ with any text of your choice. When updating this text, please ensure that ‘- ‘ is still present at the end of that line.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>622 Solutions</name></author><category term="[&quot;Send Invoices&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Click on Email Settings in the left menu bar of our application &amp;amp; click on Email Content tab in this page.

These details are shown to your customer in the ‘Supplier Address’ section of the invoice. In this article, we’ll guide you through how you can change or remove these address details.&lt;/p&gt;

If your business’s registered name is not the same as that of your store and you need to show this in your invoice, enter your business name here. This business name will be shown right underneath your store name in the ‘Supplier Address’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

To change your email address shown to customers in your invoice, enter the new/updated email address here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In the field labelled “Tax Regn. Number”, you can enter the specific registration number that you need to show in your invoice. The number you enter here will be shown underneath your address in the invoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the image above, the business’s ABN registration number is “XXXX123456” and so they’ve entered “ABN: XXXX123456” in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

As a 2 person team (and a small business owner ourselves), we understand that it’s important to be careful of your costs in the initial days of starting your business. That’s why we’ve crafted a Pay-as-you-go starter pricing plan, so that you can worry less about the costs and spend more time focusing on the core needs of your entrepreneurial journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the date you subscribe to the Pay-as-you-go plan, &lt;b&gt;you get 50 invoices to print, send or download absolutely FREE until the same date in the next month&lt;/b&gt;. If, and only if, you end up printing, sending or downloading more than 50 invoices in this time period, we charge a small usage fee of $9.99 to your store. But along with this usage charge, you get access to UNLIMITED invoices for the rest of that time period. We will notify you via email if you’ve been charged for a particular month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your 50 invoices limit is reset every month. This means that if you end up being charged a usage fee for a particular month, your limit will be reset and you will not be charged a usage fee for the next month if you do not print, send or download more than 50 invoices in that month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example - If you signed up to our Pay-as-you-go plan on Dec 12, then your billing cycles will be Dec 12 - Jan 11, Jan 12 - Feb 11 and so on. If you use more than 50 invoices in the Dec 12 - Jan 11 cycle, the $9.99 usage fee will be added to your next Shopify bill. In the next Jan 12 - Feb 11 cycle, you will get 50 free invoices again and you will not be charged if you do not cross the monthly limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To see your limit reset date, please click on the ‘Pricing &amp;amp; Plans’ tab in the top right corner of our app. You can also click on this link - &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.invoicefalcon.com/pricing&quot;&gt;See my reset date in Invoice Falcon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Invoice Design&lt;/strong&gt; in the left menu bar of our application &amp;amp; click on &lt;strong&gt;Invoice Number, Date &amp;amp; Copies&lt;/strong&gt; tab in this page. You’ll see a few settings that look like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/design-invoice/number.png&quot; alt=&quot;an image alt text&quot; title=&quot;Invoice number options in Invoice Falcon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;By default, Invoice Falcon will use the order number (or draft order number) as the document number.&lt;/b&gt; Documents that are created manually (for example, invoices or quotes that are not linked to a Shopify order/draft order) will follow their own numbering sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an order on your store is labelled/identified as “IFS-1080-EN”, then the default invoice number will also be “IFS-1080-EN”.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Use order number instead of order name&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shopify uses two separate identifiers for every order on your store. One of them is order name, which is the label/identifier to your customers and the other is order number, which Shopify tracks and is known only to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an order name is ‘IFS-1080-EN’, the order number is ‘1080’. (Please note that this might not be the case for your store.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, Invoice Falcon uses the order name as the default invoice number for your invoices. If you’d like to use the order number as the invoice number, enable the checkbox labelled “Use order number instead of order name”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom number sequence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you set up a custom numbering sequence, the invoices will have a number that are completely different from the order names/numbers for which they are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set this up, enter a number of your choice in the &lt;strong&gt;Next Invoice Number&lt;/strong&gt; field. You can enter a number like ‘10001’ or ‘ABGN12034’. Make sure to click ‘Save Changes after entering your number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The custom number will be automatically increased by 1 every time you create a new invoice. For example, if the number saved was “ABGN12034”, the second invoice created will have the number “ABGN12035”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - &lt;em&gt;If you want to stop using a custom numbering sequence, remove the number from the Next Invoice Number field and click ‘Save Changes’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Invoice Number Prefix&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to use the same name/number as your order, &lt;em&gt;but you’d also like to have a prefix or identifier to indicate that the document is an invoice&lt;/em&gt; (as may be required by law in some countries), enter the prefix in the &lt;strong&gt;Invoice Number Prefix&lt;/strong&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example - If your order number is &lt;strong&gt;#1080&lt;/strong&gt; and the invoice number prefix is &lt;strong&gt;IFS&lt;/strong&gt;, the invoice number will be &lt;strong&gt;IFS#1080&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Invoice numbers for any invoices created before changing the numbering sequence settings here &lt;i&gt;will not be updated automatically&lt;/i&gt;. If you’d like to change or reset the numbers for previous invoices, please contact us via customer support widget inside Invoice Falcon or email us at invoicefalcon.shopify@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>622 Solutions</name></author><category term="[&quot;Design your invoice&quot;]" /><summary type="html">With Invoice Falcon, you can choose to have the numbers for your invoices follow the same number as your orders, or you can set a custom numbering sequence that gets updated automatically.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Add a link to the invoice in Order Confirmation Email</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/include%20links%20to%20invoices/2019/11/16/order-confirmation-email-invoice.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Add a link to the invoice in Order Confirmation Email" /><published>2019-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/include%20links%20to%20invoices/2019/11/16/order-confirmation-email-invoice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/include%20links%20to%20invoices/2019/11/16/order-confirmation-email-invoice.html">&lt;p&gt;When a customer places an order on your store, Shopify sends an email, called the &lt;em&gt;Order Confirmation&lt;/em&gt; email, that informs the customer about their order. This email includes a link to the order, products purchased &amp;amp; their quantities, shipping &amp;amp; billing addresses and the payment method used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Invoice Falcon, you can place a link to the invoice for their order in this email. When customers click on this link, they will be redirected to a PDF invoice that they can choose to print or download to their device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/order-confirmed.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add this link to your Order Confirmation Email, you will need to add a tiny snippet of code to your Order Confirmation Email Template. Click on this link to generate the code and for a step-by-step guide on how to save it in your template - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.invoicefalcon.com/emailcode&quot;&gt;Order Confirmation Email in Invoice Falcon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can follow these steps below -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In your Shopify admin dashboard, click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here, click on the &lt;strong&gt;Order Confirmed&lt;/strong&gt; notification. You will be directed to a page that lets you edit the the template.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open this video guide to find out where exactly you should paste the snippet of code - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxK2zmv671U&quot;&gt;Video Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, copy and paste this code to the template -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Invoice Falcon Email Code START --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;table class='container' style='margin-bottom:25px'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href='https://app.invoicefalcon.com/pdfs/{{ id }}.pdf?shopify_domain=invoicefalconstore.myshopify.com'&amp;gt;Download Invoice&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Invoice Falcon Email Code END --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - &lt;em&gt;Replace ‘invoicefalconstore.myshopify.com’ with your store’s myshopify link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt; and that’s it!

The first step we recommend is to set the language for your invoices and the emails they will be sent in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Invoice Design&lt;/strong&gt; in the left menu bar of our application &amp;amp; click on &lt;strong&gt;Invoice &amp;amp; Email Language&lt;/strong&gt; tab in this page. You’ll see a few settings that look like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/design-invoice/language.png&quot; alt=&quot;an image alt text&quot; title=&quot;Language Options in Invoice Falcon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invoice Falcon supports 23 languages out of the box - English, Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, &amp;amp; Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Invoice Language&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the language of the invoice. Click on the dropdown to select your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Language&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the language that the email will sent in. Click on the dropdown to select your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Automatically detect &amp;amp; send invoice based on customer's language&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your Shopify order information also includes the language and region of the customer that placed the order. Enable this option, if you want Invoice Falcon to automatically detect, and send the invoice based on your customer’s language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This option is supported only for the languages supported by our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) If we are unable to automatically detect the language of your customer, the invoice will be sent based on the language selected in &lt;em&gt;Invoice Language&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Email Language&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected your preferred settings, make sure to click the &lt;strong&gt;Save Changes&lt;/strong&gt; button. If you’ve created any invoices before setting your language, they will be automatically updated with the new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-language-isnt-listed-what-do-i-do&quot;&gt;My language isn’t listed. What do I do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry! You have a couple of options here -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Contact us 24*7 via live chat or email at invoicefalcon.shopify@gmail.com, and we’ll add it for you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) You can also set up your own language for the invoice without contacting us. Head back to the &lt;strong&gt;Invoice Settings&lt;/strong&gt; page, and find the section named &lt;strong&gt;Edit Titles &amp;amp; Labels&lt;/strong&gt;. In this section, you can add your own translation for each header, title &amp;amp; label in the invoice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>622 Solutions</name></author><category term="[&quot;Design your invoice&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Invoice Falcon is packed with a ton of features, all dedicated to helping you set up your invoices exactly as you need them.
