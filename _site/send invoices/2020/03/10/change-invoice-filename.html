    <p>When you download an invoice or send it to your customer from Invoice Falcon, the invoice is sent as a PDF with the file name being the name of the order. That is, if the order for which you are generating the invoice is ‘#1089’, then the filename will be ‘#1089.pdf’. In this article, we’ll walk you through how you can change this to a name of your choice.</p>

<p>Click on <strong>Invoice Settings</strong> in the left menu bar of our application. You’ll see a few settings that look like this -</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/send-invoice/filename.png" alt="an image alt text" title="Change filename" /></p>

<p>In the section labelled “Download/attachment filename”, you’ll find a text field where you can change the name of the PDF file. We’ve exposed a few liquid variables that you can use to further customise the name.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>{{shop.name}}</u></strong>
<br />
This will resolve to the name of your Shopify store in the file name.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>{{order.name}}</u></strong>
<br />
This variable will resolve to the name of the order for which the invoice was generated. For example - ‘IFS-1080-EN’, ‘#1089’ etc.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>{{invoice.number}}</u></strong>
<br />
This variable will resolve to the specific number of the invoice. Use this variable if you have a custom invoice numbering sequence or if you’re using a number prefix. For example - ‘ABRN1239090’, ‘INV-987899’</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Example - if you’d like your filename to ‘FalconStore - Invoice ABRNH12340 for Order #1089’, then you can set up the text in the field as - ‘{{shop.name}} - Invoice {{invoice.number}} for Order {{order.name}}’</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Make sure to click ‘Save’ after you’re done! Your existing invoices will be automatically updated to include the changes you made here the next time it’s printed, sent or downloaded. :)</p>
