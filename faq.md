### How can I print or send invoices in bulk?
To print or send invoices in bulk, select at least two or more orders from the ‘Orders’ tab in Invoice Falcon. Next, you’ll see two actions above the list, one titled “Print Invoices” and the other “Send Invoices”.

Clicking on these buttons will print all the invoices and send it to the customers in bulk respectively.

### What is the Plus plan?
Our Plus plan is designed to be your life-long partner in your invoicing needs. For just $10/month, here’s what you get -

_Unlimited Invoicing_ - Send, print and download invoices for unlimited orders. No usage limits whatsoever!

<br/>
<br/>
### (FREE PLAN) If I send the invoice for an order in one month and re-send it again after the order limit is reset, is it counted towards that month’s limit?
Nope. If you’ve printed or sent the invoice for an order once, you’ll be able to print or send it, as many times as you wish to, for the lifetime of your store.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### I'm not able to see the invoice when I click "Print" or "Download".
This is most likely because your browser, by default, blocks popups and new tabs opened from the current page. An icon for this will be shown in the address bar. Simply click on the icon, and enable popups from our page or click on the link visible there to open the invoice.
